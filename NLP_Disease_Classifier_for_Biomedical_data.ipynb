      "INTRODUCTION: Orthokeratology (ortho-K) is an established intervention for \n",
      "myopia control in children, yet the vascular mechanisms within the choroidal \n",
      "sublayers underlying its efficacy remain unclear. This study aims to investigate \n",
      "the changes in the choroidal vascularity index (CVI) of choroid sublayers after \n",
      "ortho-K treatment, the association between 1-month CVI changes and 1-year axial \n",
      "length (AL) elongation, and the role of CVI responses in predicting the 1-year \n",
      "control efficacy of ortho-K treatment.\n",
      "METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted, enrolling 257 children with \n",
      "myopia aged 7-16 years. The subjects wore ortho-K lenses continuously for \n",
      "12 months. Choroidal volume, vascular volume (CVV), stromal volume (CSV), and \n",
      "CVI of the choroid sublayers were assessed using optical coherence tomography \n",
      "images at baseline and 1-month follow-up. The total choroidal layer (TCL) \n",
      "includes the large-vessel choroidal layer (LVCL) and the medium-vessel choroidal \n",
      "layer (MVCL). The Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid \n",
      "divides the macular area into nine subfields for detailed analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: The 1-month CVI of TCL and MVCL in all ETDRS grid regions were \n",
      "significantly lower than the baseline CVI (P ≤ 0.036), except for the superior \n",
      "outer ring subfield in TCL (P = 0.070). After the 1-month ortho-K treatment, \n",
      "both choroidal volume and CSV significantly increased in all choroidal sublayers \n",
      "compared with baseline data (P ≤ 0.027), while CVV also showed significant \n",
      "increases in half of the ETDRS grid regions (14/27). After adjusting for age and \n",
      "gender, the baseline CVI of temporal inner ring subfield in TCL (β = 0.146, \n",
      "P = 0.006), and 1-month CVI changes of the temporal outer ring subfield \n",
      "(β = 0.337, P < 0.001) and nasal inner ring subfield (β = 0.174, P = 0.002) in \n",
      "MVCL, were independently associated with 1-year AL elongation during ortho-K \n",
      "treatment. On the basis of the 1-month CVI changes of temporal outer ring \n",
      "subfield and nasal inner ring subfield in MVCL, as well as age and sex, the \n",
      "prediction model demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905 (95% CI \n",
      "0.870-0.941) for distinguishing children with myopia who exhibited slow versus \n",
      "fast AL elongation.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: After the 1-month ortho-K treatment, choroidal volume, CVV, and \n",
      "CSV, of all choroidal sublayers significantly increased, while CVI of TCL and \n",
      "MVCL significantly decreased. The CVI in LVCL showed no significant changes. The \n",
      "differences in short-term CVI changes among choroidal sublayers indicate \n",
      "disproportionate changes in CVV and CSV, which help to explore the possible \n",
      "choroidal mechanisms of myopia control with ortho-K treatment. Early CVI changes \n",

      "BACKGROUND: Kidney function declines faster in patients with type 2 diabetes \n",
      "mellitus (T2DM) than in those without, and coronary artery calcification is a \n",
      "risk factor for adverse kidney outcomes. Thus, we examined whether T2DM modified \n",
      "the relationship between coronary artery calcification and chronic kidney \n",
      "disease (CKD) progression.\n",
      "METHODS: Among 2067 participants from the KoreaN Cohort Study for Outcome in \n",
      "Patients With CKD, the main exposures analyzed were T2DM and coronary artery \n",
      "calcification. The primary outcome was CKD progression, which was a composite \n",
      "of > 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or kidney \n",
      "failure requiring kidney replacement therapy. A multivariable cause-specific \n",
      "hazard model was used to determine the association between the main exposures \n",
      "and the primary outcome.\n",
      "RESULTS: During 8633 person-years of follow-up, the primary outcome occurred in \n",
      "565 (27.3%) participants. After adjusting for confounding factors, T2DM and \n",
      "coronary artery calcification score > 0 were associated with 2.03- and 1.51-fold \n",
      "increased risks of CKD progression, respectively. T2DM and coronary artery \n",
      "calcification showed a significant interaction in terms of the primary outcome. \n",
      "In patients with T2DM, coronary artery calcification score > 0 was associated \n",
      "with a significantly higher risk of CKD progression compared with coronary \n",
      "artery calcification score = 0. However, the significant association of coronary \n",
      "artery calcification score > 0 versus coronary artery calcification score = 0 \n",
      "was lost in patients without T2DM. The slope of eGFR decline was steeper in \n",

      "with T2DM or coronary artery calcification score > 0 alone.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery calcification is more strongly associated with the \n",
